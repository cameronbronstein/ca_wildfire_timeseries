This `gif` was made using QGIS and the Time Manager Plugin. To compliment the gif, I plotted various statistics per year, showing a general increase in fire frequency, land-area impacts, and mega-fire size.

### Data
This data is from Cal Fire and was formerly available [here]. Hopefully it will return to this web location.
The data depicts all historical CA fires from 1878 to 2018, including severe notable fires from 2018 (Camp Fire, Carr Fire, Mendocino Complex Fire).
